This is a Brian Tumor Prediction Project which i have done for my Software Engineering Processes, Tools and Methods Course.

In this Project I have developed almost every machine learning models and few deep learning models too.

The main thing in this project is we can identify, classify the tumors from the dataset also we can predict the tumor for unseen data too.

The dataset used for this project is attached here. https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15shUcfcEK7h2Pd5Lja4xyT3y2AH02xXx?usp=sharing
